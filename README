# OSX compatible CircleMUD 

This branch is supposed to always properly compile under OSX. It was latest tested in MacOS Sierra. From root directory, run:

```
$ compile; cd src; make;
```

To start the server, run:

```
$ bin/circle
```

And then connect to the server by:

```
telnet localhost 4000
```

The first character you create will be a superuser.
